## My Introduction
Hey I am Yaswanth S. I got to know about amFoss from my school since I was a student at Amrita Vidyalayam. I took CS as my main subject in higher secondary.
Coding is new to me as I'm not proficient in it. Also I know the basics of Python too.
By joining amFoss I hope to increase my skillsets and to know more about every aspects of coding.
